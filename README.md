# polyrhythm-metronome

## To Run:
- Install [ChucK](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/)
- `chuck metronome.ck`

## To Adjust To Your Needs:
- Mess with the Dials and Knobs section at the top of the metronome.ck file in order to alter the metronome. I poked through ChucK's docs, and didn't see any way to prompt users for this information or to pass values in as command-line arguments, or I'd have set it up so that users didn't need to alter the script itself to tune it

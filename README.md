# polyrhythm-metronome

## To Run:
- Install [ChucK](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/)
- `chuck metronome.ck`

## To Set Rhythms:
- Edit lines 1-4 to add/remove polyrhythms, set the tempo, set the beat frequency (I looked through ChucK's documentation and didn't see any way to pass arguments into the chuck command - I suppose I might be able to read from environment variables or a file, however)
